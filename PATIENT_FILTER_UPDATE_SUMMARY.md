## 🚀 Usage

### Get Filter Conditions
```bash
GET /api/v2/patientFilters
```

**New filters in response:**
```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "condition": "Age",
    "type": "number"
},
{
    "id": 9903,
    "condition": "Patient Registration Date",
    "type": "date_range",
    "fields": {
        "from": "Registration Date From",
        "to": "Registration Date To"
    }
}
```

---

### Filter by Age
```bash
POST /api/v2/patientFilters

{
    "7": "25",
    "per_page": 10,
    "page": 1
}
```

---

### Filter by Registration Date
```bash
POST /api/v2/patientFilters

{
    "9903": {
        "from": "2024-01-01",
        "to": "2024-12-31"
    },
    "per_page": 10,
    "page": 1
}
```

**Options:**
- Both dates: `{"from": "2024-01-01", "to": "2024-12-31"}`
- From only: `{"from": "2024-01-01"}`
- To only: `{"to": "2024-12-31"}`

---

### Combined Example
```json
{
    "2": "Cairo Hospital",
    "4": "Male",
    "7": "30",
    "9903": {
        "from": "2024-01-01",
        "to": "2024-06-30"
    },
    "9901": "Yes",
    "per_page": 10,
    "page": 1
}
```

This filters:
- Hospital: Cairo Hospital
- Gender: Male  
- Age: 30

## 🔍 How It Works

### Age Filter (ID 7)
- Filters by question answer in `answers` table
- Same logic as other question filters
- Matches exact age value

### Registration Date (ID 9903)
- Filters by `created_at` in `patients` table
- Uses `whereDate()` for date comparison
- Supports range filtering with from/to
